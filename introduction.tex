	\section{Background of the Study}

	The Home Power Management System using GSM with Electricity Billing Display with Bill SMS feature offers a way to access your home appliances though your phone anywhere you are. It uses a GSM receiver modem to receive information from the sender, in this case an SMS from the phone of the user, to manage the home appliances connected to the device. GSM is widely used as a global system for mobile communications, spanning Europe, Asia, Africa and much of South America. Most GSM modems uses frequencies in the 900 MHz band and is able to receive signals through SMS, then outputs a maximum power of 1 to 8 Watts. A user can send SMS to the GSM modem to turn on/off the devices connected to it. An additional feature of monitoring your electric bill and status of each appliances connected to the device will be provided. The GSM modem will be connected to a main power controller where in the other appliances are connected to be monitored, and are switched on and off by the user through their phone. 

	An additional improvement could be added by making an application to provide a user friendly GUI. Making it more visually appealing and easier for the user to check their bill, and status of each appliances. Additional features may be added such as the a monitoring system if the appliance is broken, electrical consumption of each connected appliances. Additional information of each connected appliances (Brand, Model, Watt usage, etc. ).


\section{Prior Studies}

	According to the research done by Brush et al. (2011), home automation has not been widely adopted. Based on the study, it is because of the high cost of ownership, inflexibility, poor manageability, and difficulty in terms of security. Even though some of the experiences of the users were negative, majority of the households that were visited by the researchers said that they had a positive experience about home automation. Most of the brands that was used in home automation includes the X10, Control4, Elk, M1, HAI, Creston, Lagotek, and Leviton. The products of the brands mentioned includes lighting controls, multi-room audio/video systems, security cameras, and motion detectors. Also, the researchers observed that there are two levels of automation in use. One is the user controlled while the other is rule-based. In user controlled automation, the home automation needs to have a command that needs to be done or said. On the other hand, rule-based automation does not require any external commands. The system is triggered by using motion sensors or by setting up the system to do an action that involves time.

	In the present day, home automation can be done by using a mobile phone. A research conducted by Mahesh Jivani last 2014. Jivani (2014) stated that the Global System for Mobile Communication or the GSM and the use of cellular phones can be used for communicating with other devices at a distance. It can be applied to the home automation by using the bluetooth and the Wi-Fi. Based on the research, an android phone can be used to send an SMS through the GSM network. After that, the modem receives the SMS which is then passed to the arduino microcontroller. After the microcontroller, the data is then sent to the peripheral drivers and the relays. Finally, the command is accepted by the appliances.

	Internet Based Wireless Home Automation System for Multifunctional Devices was researched by Alkar and Buhur (2005). This paper features a low cost and flexible web-based solution to home automation. However, this system has some limitations such as the range of communication and power failure problems.

	A Home Appliance Control System (HACS) was researched by Malik et al. (2009). The research focused on remotely controlling home appliances and at the same time offers security when the owner is not near the place where the system was installed. They proposed the usage of GSM technology to provide control from SMS that are sent from the user’s mobile device. The use of SMS makes the system more convenient and accessible. Security measures (e.g. Motion Sensors) that are installed within the place of choice may also trigger the HACS to send SMS to the user’s mobile phone when intrusion occurs.
	
	In the research paper by Conte and Scaradozzi (2003), the researchers view home automation systems as multiple agent systems (MAS). The home automation system that they proposed includes home appliances and devices that are controlled and maintained for home management. The major task of their research is to improve the performance of the current home automation systems that are available.


\section{Problem Statement}

	The students want to monitor and know the amount of electricity used by appliances and the correspondent cost. Also, being able to control the appliances through mobile devices using GSM would be a part of the research. One of the main problem in the world today is high electricity consumption and most of the users are clueless about the problem. The world today revolves around the technology and electricity consumption plays a big role for it. Most of the consumers and users do not know the cost of the electricity being consumed not until the bill comes. But being able to see the cost and the amount electricity used, the users will be able to control and lessen or lower electricity consumption. Energy saving is a must because the resources we have today will not be enough for the next generation if high electricity consumption is not solved.

\section{Significance of the Study}

	In today’s modern world of technology, high-tech appliances are every man’s best friend in terms of convenience and . However, these instruments that make a person’s life easier are subject to major discrepancies such as and most importantly high power usage due to its advanced specifications. This in turn would affect the amount of money a household should spend in order to compensate the expenses. For some families, it would be alright to leave the air conditioning and any other appliance on but for those that would like to budget their money, our study would be certainly useful.

	In today’s generation, it is highly unlikely that someone does not own a smart phone. These mobiles take up so much of our time and attention that it is almost never not in our hands. This norm is what drives the researchers into thinking that an SMS based study would be the most appropriate. By allowing a user easy access to turn on and off just by sending a text, we provide a platform for convenience.

	Other than the SMS being a controlling system, it paves way to provide a monthly billing display sent to the user. The importance of this is that it would lessen the casualties of bills being tampered. This would be a great advantage to electricity companies in terms of its relation with the customers.
